# 🧹 Blinkit Data Cleaning Pipeline
Overview
This repository contains a Python-based data cleaning and preprocessing pipeline for Blinkit’s grocery and sales dataset. It focuses on transforming raw Blinkit data—collected from grocery delivery logs—into clean, analysis-ready tables. Ideal for anyone working on data science, ETL, or BI projects involving real-world datasets. 

## ✅ Features

- Standardization: Normalizes categorical fields like "Low Fat" vs "Regular" with consistent casing and spelling 

- Missing & Duplicate Handling: Detects and addresses missing values, duplicates, whitespace, and formatting glitches using pandas techniques 

- Data Type Conversion: Ensures numeric and date fields have the correct types for reliable analysis.

- Automated Scripts: Includes reusable Python scripts/notebooks to sequentially clean new dataset versions.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3.x – core scripting

- pandas & NumPy – data manipulation and transformation

- Jupyter Notebook – documentable, step-by-step workflow (renders beautifully on GitHub)

## 🎯 Why This Project Matters

- Demonstrates real-world data cleaning skills essential for deeper analysis—resolving inconsistent labels, removing duplicates, imputing missing fields.

- Prepares Blinkit data for downstream exploration, modeling, or BI dashboards (e.g. using Power BI or Python visualizations) 

- Acts as a portfolio-ready project showcasing your ETL and data-wrangling abilities.
